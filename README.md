What is Gorilla?
================

Gorilla is a C++ based HUD and simple 2D overlay system for the [Ogre3D] graphics
engine, it comes in two files Gorilla.cpp and Gorilla.h

[Ogre3D]: http://www.ogre3d.org

Gorilla is intended to substitute the Ogre overlay system, and to provide
a good framework and basis for any Ogre programmer to build their HUD or GUI
system upon.

Gorilla is designed for speed; It uses Texture Atlases and tries to render
everything in one batch. 

Gorilla can support

* Filled (Solid, Gradient or Sprite-based) Rectangles (Canvas Rectangles)
* Outlined Rectangles (Canvas Boxes)
* Lines with n-thickness (Canvas Lines)
* Sprites (SpriteLayer Sprites)
* Plain and formatted text (Canvas Captions and Text)

Beastie only uses Ogre as a dependency, and is developed with Ogre 1.7 in mind;  
but should work with any 1.x version.


Using Gorilla
=============

All of Gorilla's classes are contained in the `Gorilla` namespace. All classes and member functions use the `camelCase` notation, with the exception that class names the first letter is always captialised.

To include Gorilla in your project, simply copy the two Gorilla files `Gorilla.cpp` and `Gorilla.h` into your project. Making sure you correctly include and link to Ogre. To increase compliation speed you may want to `#include` Gorilla in your static headers file.

Main classes
============

The main class is called "Silverback" named after the Head Gorilla. Silverback is responsible for the `Screen` and `TextureAtlas` classes. 

Silverback is a singleton so should be created roughly after Root is created and destroyed just before. Screens are tied to the same level as SceneManagers, so any the lifetime of a Screen is the same as a SceneManager. A TextureAtlas will retain the same lifetime as the Silverback.

To create the Silverback, just create an instance

    mSilverback = new Gorilla::Silverback();


TextureAtlas
============

*Please note*: There is a seperate file explaining the Gorilla file format.

The TextureAtlas file represents a `.gorilla` file which contains all the needed information that describes the portions of a single texture. Such as Glyph and Sprite information, text kerning, line heights and so on. It isn't typically used by the end-user.

To load in a `.gorilla` file simply, load it in.

    mSilverback->loadAtlas("dejavu")
  
This will reference the "dejavu.gorilla" file in the General ResourceGroup. The dejavu.gorilla file and accompanying image file may then be stored in a sub-directory or compressed file, assuming Ogre can access it.

Screen
======

A screen is a container class for all 2D operations upon the RenderWindow, it is comparible in function to the SceneManager. Each Screen may use a seperate TextureAtlas or share one together, but each Screen rendered seperately as one batch. So five screens is one batch. Typically it is normal just to have one screen, or a second one for debug output.

Screens need a Viewport to render too, and will get the SceneManager from the Viewport's Camera to listen for drawing updates. All Screen drawings are done after the RENDER_QUEUE_OVERLAY renderqueue.

    Gorilla::Screen* screen = mSilverback->createScreen(mViewport, "dejavu");


Canvas, Text and SpriteLayers
=============================

There are three main types of operations that are drawn onto the screen;

* Canvas
* Text
* SpriteLayer

Like Screen's you can have many Canvases, Text or SpriteLayers. Collectively these are known as Renderables. As all of these belong to a single Screen, they are all rendered in the same single batch.

To help with z-ordering, renderables are assigned to a layer from 0-15. Renderables on layer 0 are rendered first and on 15 rendered last. This means that anything on layer 15 will be "on top" of layer 14, 13 on 12, 12 on 10 and so on.

**Please note:** everything in Gorilla unless specified is measured in *pixels* and not screen coordinates.

Handles
-------

In the Canvas and SpriteLayer classes, portions of these are handled by size_t types known as "handles", or if you wish an internal id for a line, box, sprite, etc.

To change a line colour for example; you need to pass on the new colour, and the handle of the line you wish to change, to the Canvas, setLineColour function. 

Canvas
------

The Canvas class is the bulk of Gorilla, it is used to draw Rectangles, Boxes, Lines and non-formatted single lined text known as Captions. Typically for the shape drawing operations a single white pixel is reserved on the Texture which the shapes use the UV coordinates for. Captions (like its big brother Text) use the Glyphs from the TextureAtlas.

    screen->createCanvas(3)   // where 3 is the layer number, 0 is default.

Text
----

Text is a renderable which it's sole purpose is to draw a large block of text that may cover multiple lines, be in different colours and even have sprites inserted within the text itself.

Text is reserved for "big" things; such as messages, command prompts, rather than little things than the health of the player (which would probably be done in a Canvas using a Caption).

Text uses a markup system to change colours (these are set/fetched from the TextureAtlas palette), to inserting sprites into the text.

A sample of the markup is as follows:

    Wow look at this %4scary%R picture of an Ogre! %:ogre_head%

Which means draw the text, but for "scary" render it in colour 4, and after "Ogre!" put the sprite "ogre_head" there.


SpriteLayer
-----------

A SpriteLayer is to draw 2D quads on the screen known as sprites. You may use sprites for a number of things from displaying the inventory of the player, to a full mini 2D shoot 'em up.


Classes
=======

Silverback
----------

### void loadAtlas(const Ogre::String& name, const Ogre::String& group)

Create a TextureAtlas from a ".gorilla" file. Name is the name of
the TextureAtlas, as well as the first part of the filename of the gorilla file; i.e. name.gorilla, the gorilla file can be loaded from a different resource group if you give that name as the second argument, otherwise it will assume to be "General".

### Screen*  createScreen(Ogre::Viewport*, const Ogre::String& atlas)

Create a Screen using a Viewport and a name of a previously loaded TextureAtlas. Both must exist. The screen will register itself as a RenderQueueListener to the SceneManager that has the Camera which is tied to the Viewport.

Each screen is considered a new batch. To reduce your batch count in Gorilla, reduce the number of screens you use.

### void  destroyScreen(Screen*);

Destroy an existing screen (and contents).

Screen
------

### Canvas*  createCanvas(int layer)

Create a new Canvas to draw too. If layer is omitted then "0" is assumed to be the layer, otherwise layer id must be between 0 and 15.

As with screens there can be many Canvases per screen.

### SpriteLayer*  createSpriteLayer(int layer)

Create a new SpriteLayer for Sprites.  If layer is omitted then "0" is assumed to be the layer, otherwise layer id must be between 0 and 15.

As with screens there can be many SpriteLayers per screen.

### Text*  createText(Ogre::Real left, Ogre::Real top, const Ogre::String& initialText, int layer)

Create a formatted text on the screen, with the coordinates given as left and top. initialText can be blank if desired.

If layer is omitted then "0" is assumed to be the layer, otherwise layer id must be between 0 and 15.

#### Markup codes.

    %x              Change Text Colour (x = 0..9), See TextureAtlas::getPaletteColour
    %R              Reset Text Colour to normal
    %M              Switch to monospace mode of writing (ignore kerning and fixed glyph width).
    %:spritename%   Insert a sprite named "spritename" here. Line height for this line only will
                    be changed to the height of the sprite.
    %%              Insert a percentage sign %.

### void  destroy(Renderable*)
